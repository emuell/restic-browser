A simple, cross-platform [restic backup](https://github.com/restic/restic) GUI for browsing and restoring restic repositories. 

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app), based on leaanthony's [Restoric](https://github.com/leaanthony/restoric) PoC. 

Older versions of the restic browser were built using [Wails2](https://wails.io). The latest release based on Wails is [v0.2.6](https://github.com/emuell/restic-browser/releases/tag/v0.2.6). 

## Download

Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/emuell/restic-browser/releases) page.


## Features

This is not a fullblown restic backup GUI - it only allows you to *browse* existing repositories!

* *Displays* contents (snapshots, files) from local and remote restic repositories.
* *Dumps* selected files or folders (as a zip archive) to a desired location.
* *Restores* selected files or folders to a desired location.
* *Opens* selected files by moving them to TEMP, then opens them with your operating system's default programs.

## System Requirements

#### All platforms
- Install [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/) and *make sure it is included in your $PATH*.<br />
  On MacOS, where setting the PATH for desktop applications is a really hard thing to do, the restic executable will also be found if it's in one of the following folders: `/usr/local/bin, /opt/local/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin, ~/bin`.

#### Windows:
- Windows 10 or later with [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section)

#### MacOS:
- macOS 10.13 or later

#### Linux:
- Linux with GLIBC_2.35 or later (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04 or later)
- WebKit2 (install via `apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1` on Ubuntu)
- Try using the Linux appimage from the prebuilt releases, in case libwebkit2gtk-4.1 is not available on your system.

## Development

### Dependencies

* Follow the [Tauri Prerequisites Docs](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) to install a *C/C++ toolchain* and *Rust* 1.78 or later for your platform.
* Make sure [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download) *Node* 18 LTS or later is installed.
* Install [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/) and make sure it is included in your $PATH. 
  
Note: installing the tauri CLI via cargo is not necessary. Tauri can be launched through npm (see below). 

### Front-end and App Development

To work in live development mode with automatic hot-reloading, run `npm run tauri dev` in the root directory. 

### Rust Backend Debugging

To debug the Tauri Rust application code, you can use the included startup tasks of vscode. If you press "F5" in vscode, the application will be built in debug mode and then started.   

### Building Production Packages

To build a redistributable package in production mode, run `npm run tauri build` in the root directory.
